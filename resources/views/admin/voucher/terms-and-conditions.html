                     <img src="images/line-1.png">
                     <p class="contant_area">Welcome to Grigora ("Grigora ", "we", "us" and "our"). This terms and conditions(“Terms”) are applied to and governing the usage of our mobile application (the “app”). PLEASE KINDLY READ THIS TERMS AND CONDITIONS CAREFULLY.

                     <h3>ABOUT GRIGORA</h3>
                     <p class="contant_area">Grigora is a mobile application operated by Grigora Limited, incorporated and registered in Nigeria, whose registered office is at 2nd Floor, St. James House, 167 Ademola Adetokunbo Crescent, Wuse, Abuja, FCT. Grigora is a food delivery business where the food is prepared by independent restaurants (our "Partner Restaurants") and delivered by us.</p>
                     <h3>ACCEPTANCE</h3>

Any order that you place on the app is subject to availability, delivery capacity and acceptance both by us and the restaurant. Once you placed an order on the app, we will send you a notification to confirm that we have received it. This confirmation will be produced automatically and will just give you confirmation of your order details so that you can check that all details are correct. Once we have sent the notification, we will check availability and delivery capacity. If the restaurant you chose to order accepts the order it will confirm it to Grigora.</p>

We will inform you of an estimated delivery time for your Item before you place the order, but we will attempt delivery as soon as possible; you must therefore be available to accept delivery from the time you place the order. For a Scheduled Delivery, we will tell you the time when the Item is expected to be delivered; you must be available to accept delivery.</p>

If you cancel any order after it becomes a Started Order, you will be charged the full price for the Items.</p>
